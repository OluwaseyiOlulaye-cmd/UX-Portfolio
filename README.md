# UX-Portfolio
Created my portfolio for the Google UX Certificate Course

I challenged myself to create my UX portfolio using my skills in HTML and CSS. For this portfolio, there were no frameworks used - it was just pure HTML and CSS, and although it took more time than I thought, I enjoyed the process and for being able to figure out and find solutions to my layouts made it more fulfilling.
