                            <p>Availabe volunteer-based organizations lack the understanding of what motivates people to
                                volunteer – and so they fail to put their needs into considerations making the
                                registration process long, intimidating and unfulfilling
                                .</p>

                                providing a mobile friendly, less demanding, quick and fast registration process and
                                fast response time.

                            <p>Virtuous Volunteer is an African-based social enterprise organization that offers
                                passionate volunteers an easy and intuitive way to offer thier skills, service and time
                                to non-profit organizations.
                                Virtuous Volunteer strives to provide a less rigorous but effective volunteer
                                recruitment whilst nurturing the needs of volunteers.

                    <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                    <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and
                        their needs. A primary user group identified through research was young people who needs a
                        mobile-friendly, quick registration process and fast response time to their application.
                        .</p>
                    <p>This user group confirmed initial assumption that the application process takes time , but
                        research also revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users from volunteering their
                        services. Other user problems included lack of response, and demanding application process with
                        unnecessary questions which could be answered later when their application to the organization
                        is successful – it becomes more frustrating when after all the long process of application,
                        their application wasn’t considered successful.

                                makes the experience not user-friendly.</p>

                        Tobiloba is a young nurse who needs to fill a volunteer application form for an organization
                        because she wants the opportunity to offer her time, skills and service to help people in needs

                    <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                    <p>Difficulty with the volunteer registration form was a primary pain point for users, so I used
                        that knowledge to create a sitemap to guide the organizational structure of each screen’s design
                        to ensure a simple, quick and consistent experience across devices.

                    <h3>Paper wireframes</h3>
                    <p>Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements
                        that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points. The home
                        screen paper variations below prioritized an <strong>optimized browsing experience and easy
                            navigation

                    <h3>Screen size variations</h3>
                    <p>Because intending volunteers access the site on a variety of different devices especially on
                        mobile, I started to work on designs for additional screens to make sure the site would be fully
                        responsive
                        .</p>

                            I also added the terms and conditions for their clients to acknowledge to this screen.</p>
