                    <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                    <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and
                        their
                        needs. A primary user group identified through research was commercial caterers
                        (outdoor/indoor)
                        who needs to have an efficient planning process to meet her customers order on time.</p>
                    <p>This user group confirmed initial assumptions lack of quick and easy access to current market
                        prices
                        , but research also revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users from order’s
                        delivery.
                        Other user problems included obligations, interests, or challenges that make it difficult to
                        get/transport groceries for cooking or cooked food to the party venues; and access to a catering
                        learning platform for more professional development.</p>

                        screen,
                        I prioritized a <strong>quick and easy listings/ordering process to help users save

                        designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed
                        what aspects of the mockups needed refining. </p>

                            <p>One quote from peer feedback:
                                <i>“Great job. I particularly like your color wheel and the design of the app made it so
                                    easy
                                    and
                                    quick to have an idea of market prices ! I would definitely use this app as a go-to
                                    for
                                    quick
                                    market prices and my online quotation generation”</i>

                            <h4>What I learned:</h4>
                            <p>The app makes users feel like CateringMenu app really thinks about how to meet their
                                needs.</p>
                            <p>While designing the CateringMenu app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only
                                the
                                beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration
                                of the
                                app’s
                                designs.</p>
                            <p>I learned that to put users front and center and to meet their needs through design, I
                                can’t
                                afford
                                to miss any step or process of the design thinking.</p>
